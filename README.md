## Features

-   Faster data transfer: The app allows users to transfer files quickly and efficiently without the need for a centralized server. This makes the transfer process faster and more reliable.
-   No file size limit: There are no limitations on the size of the files that can be transferred. Users can transfer files of any size.
-   Greater data privacy: Since the transfer is peer to peer, data is not stored on a centralized server, which means greater data privacy and security.
-   Progress visibility: The data is transferred in small chunks, which allows both the sender and receiver to see the progress of the transfer.
